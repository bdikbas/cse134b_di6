  <p>
    Stephen Curry is a generational shooter whose three-point gravity completely
    changes how defenses have to play. He creates advantages both on and off the
    ball, using relocations, handoffs, and screens to constantly pressure the
    defense.

  <h2>Offensive strengths</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Deep three-point shooting off the dribble and off the catch.</li>
    <li>Elite off-ball movement through relocations and cuts.</li>
    <li>Pick-and-roll creation that bends defenses toward half-court.</li>
    <li>Elite ball-handling skills to create space for himself to get his shot off.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Impact on teammates</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Opens driving lanes for slashers because defenders stay glued to him.</li>
    <li>Makes bigs more effective as screeners and short-roll passers.</li>
    <li>Forces constant defensive communication, creating lots of breakdowns.</li>
  </ul>
